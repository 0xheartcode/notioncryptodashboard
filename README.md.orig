Mmm, might need to add a little structure to this document.
Here is the structure for this little project.


1) Connect to Notion.so API
2) Ping database with script
3) Fetch database with python
4) Clean up database in JSON
5) Fetch single coingeckoID (this will be our unique ID) from database
6) Fetch multiple coingeckoID from database

--> we are here <--

7) overwrite values of coingeckoIDs with 1 in the price column
8) overwrite values in 2 separate columns with 1 and 2s.

9) use the list from the coingeckoIDs from the database to go to coingecko and wetch live price.
10) write fetched price into notions API.

11) to the stars and beyond.
